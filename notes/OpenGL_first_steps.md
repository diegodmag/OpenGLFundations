## About OpenGL and shaders 

### Vertex Shader
Regardless of where the vertex are generated, all vertex pass through the *vertex shader*. So, the *vertex shader* is executed once per vertex. 

### About the pipeline 
First, the vertex passed to the vertex shader and the it is send to the *rasterizer*, where the vertex are transformed into pixel locations(or more accurately *fragments*). Eventually, this pixel (fragments) reach the fragment shader.

*This is how I understood the pipeline*
1. Vertex Shader -> Manipulate one vertex at a time
2. Geometry Shander
3. Rasterization -> Fill those gaps between each vertex using linear interpolation
4. Fragment Shader -> Manipuate one pixel at a time


### About the fragment shader and color buffer 
Pixel colors are generated by the fragment shader. The pixel colors are placed in the *color buffer* - it is the color buffer that is ultimately written to the screen.

### About how is the data send down the pipeline
When sets of data are prepared for sending down the pipeline, they are organized into buffers.

### About Hidden Surface Removal
When an object is drawn, we usually expect objects in front to block block our view of objects behind them. To accomplish this, we need *hidden surface removal* which is accomplished by OpenGL through the cleverly coordinated use of two buffers: *color buffer* and *depth buffer*. Both buffers are the same size as the raster- that is, *there is an entry in each buffer for every pixel on the screen.*
